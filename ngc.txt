This is calling getPassword() from NgcClient, which indicates that secrets are being fetched from the NGC Client.
	•	The function System.getenv("JDBC_PASSWORD_KEY") suggests integration with environment-based secrets.
	•	The code logs “Requesting for password from secret agent client”, which means this is a secret retrieval operation.

🟢 Why NGC Client (not Wrapper)?

✔ Secret retrieval is explicitly supported by NGC Client.
✔ NgcClient.getPassword(nickName) directly interacts with secrets, which NGC Wrapper does not support as deeply.
✔ If you ever need to extend security policies (e.g., VM-level security), NGC Client is the right choice.

You would use NGC Client Wrapper only if:
✅ You are running everything in containers (ECS-only support).
✅ You only need to retrieve secrets without any additional security features.
✅ You want minimal migration effort.

But your code involves password retrieval and environment variables, making NGC Client the better fit.
